# Checkers
This project is a two-player Checkers game that will be implemented using Python programming language. The program will prompt the user to enter their name, and if the
input is empty, it will keep asking until the user provides a valid input. Once both players' names are entered, the program will ask for their permission to start the
game.As soon as the game starts, a new text file will be created with the name "player1name_player2name_date_time.txt". This file will keep the record of all moves made
by the players during the game.

The game board will be displayed as a textual representation on the screen, with "B" indicating a blank piece, "x" indicating player 1's piece, and "o" indicating 
player 2's piece. Players will take turns to enter the position of the piece they want to move and the position they want to move it to. If the move is legal, the piece
will move, and the updated board will be displayed. 

If the move is illegal, an error message will be displayed, and the player will be prompted to re-enter the position. Players can quit the game at any time by 
entering "q" or "Q". If a player quits, the other player will be declared the winner. If a piece reaches the end of the board, it will become a king piece and can move
forward and backward. The game will end if one of the players has no legal moves left or has zero pieces on the board. The winner will be declared, and the program will 
ask if the players want to start a new game.

In conclusion, this Checkers game program will provide an enjoyable experience for two players to play against each other. Record all moves made during the game, and
allow players to quit or start a new game at any time.
